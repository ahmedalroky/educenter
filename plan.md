To implement this project, you'll need to create a MySQL database with tables for students, teachers, and classes. Then, you'll need to create a Flask application that connects to the database and provides the necessary endpoints for each dashboard. You'll also need to create web UI and mobile app interfaces for each dashboard, using a front-end framework such as React or Vue.js. Finally, you'll need to deploy the application to a server or cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.
